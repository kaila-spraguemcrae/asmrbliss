## üêõ Bugs

- * please note that there has been some connection errors with the repo after the project was pushed to gh-pages. To fix this problem with your cloned local repo you will need to remove the gh-pages dependencies and scripts from the package.json file as well as remove the public path from the webpack.config.js file. I have gone ahead and updated the main branch webpack and package files.
